### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Hamunii

I love making things that are useful to other people, and as such I'm involved in projects like [PEAKLib](https://github.com/PEAKModding/PEAKLib), the [PEAK Modding wiki](https://peakmodding.github.io/), and I created the [LC-ExampleEnemy](https://github.com/Hamunii/LC-ExampleEnemy?tab=readme-ov-file) project which is the base of nearly all Lethal Company enemy mods. I believe in documentation, so all of my stuff is also documented.

I'm working on a .NET runtime detouring library [MonoDetour](https://github.com/MonoDetour/MonoDetour) in order to improve on the experience of hooking and manipulating methods with [MonoMod](https://github.com/MonoMod/MonoMod) or [HarmonyX](https://github.com/BepInEx/HarmonyX). The library itself uses MonoMod, but also implements interop support for HarmonyX.

Also, I use Linux.

Before you go, I must share [`jj`: Jujutsuâ€”a version control system](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) with you. Before it, I barely knew git. After it, I still don't know git. But I know `jj` because it just simply makes *so much* sense. I don't even use a GUI for viewing a git graph anymore as the `jj` commandline just does it better.

> So why should you care about `jj`? Well, it has a property that's pretty rare in the world of programming: it is both simpler and easier than `git`, but at the same time, it is more powerful.
